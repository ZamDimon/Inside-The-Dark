# Inside-The-Dark
Inside The Dark is a dungeon-crawler game about exploring the dark dungeon. I did this project with a team of 3 people, in which I was the leader and programmer. In the beginning, we developed this game specifically for the ITalent competition. We made the first version in literally two months and took the 5th absolute place nationally.
