**Inside The Dark** is a dungeon-crawler turn-based videogame about exploring the dark dungeon made in *Unity*. I did this project with a team of 3 people, in which I was the leader and programmer. In the beginning, we developed this game specifically for the *ITalent* competition. We made the first version in literally two months and took the **5th** place nationally among 30+ projects.

## Contents
I included two main folders in this repository: `Scripts` and *rar* folder `Inside the Dark Build.rar`. In the folder `Scripts` you can review some of the scripts I have written for the project. It is important to note that these are not all the scripts in the game (in fact, there are more than **110** scripts in this project).

## How to launch the game?
1. Unpack the folder `Inside the Dark Build.rar`.
2. Launch `Inside the dark.exe`.
3. That's it :wink:.

## How to play the game?

Your end goal is to *find the room with the exit room*. 

### Interface
After the character creation and introductory cutscene, you will see the following menu:

**What do these numbers mean?**
1. Main window where all the actions occur.
2. Your character.
3. Menu with character's amount of money, health points (HP) and mana points (MP)
4. Menu with artifacts - items that you can wear to boost some stats.
5. Window with character's skills. You cannot use them outside the fight.
6. Inventory where you can use items. To use the item, left mouse click on it.
7. Dungeon map, which reveals as you open more and more rooms.
8. Button that opens the map.
9. Button that opens the console.
10. Button that opens the tree of skills. The number near this tree represents how many skills you can buy.
11. Button that opens the character's list of stats. You can upgrade some of them after leveling up.
12. Button that opens the dictionary where you can read pages you found on the bookshelves.
13. Button that opens the bestiary with all monsters' descriptions.
14. Exit from the game

### Moving
You can move your character *outside the battle* by pressing `A` and `D`. To move to the other room, you should select the adjacent room (see figure below). This way you will be translated to the corridor which you have to pass. You can travel **only** to adjacent rooms and while being in the room outside the fight.

### Fighting
As mentioned before, *Inside the Dark* is a turn-based game. During the fight, you will see the turn order (see number 1 on the figure below). When you get the turn, you will get from 1 to 4 action points (1 usage of any skill = 1 action point, see number 2 on the figure below). In the beginning, you can only get either 1 or 2 action points. However, you can upgrade the corresponding skill in the *skill tree* to be able to get more points.

Your goal is to kill all the enemies using your skills on the *skill panel* (number 5 on the figure with game interface). When you unlock passive skills, you will see them on the panel under number 3 (again, see figure below).
